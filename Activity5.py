#There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet #of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?

a = 98
b = 94
c = 41
d = 96
e = 11
f = a+b+c+d+e   #sum
g = f/5   #average
print('sum of five trees is',f)
print('average of trees is', g)
